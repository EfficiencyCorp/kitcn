# Autoclose PR 475

Objective:
Finish https://github.com/udecode/kitcn/pull/475 without widening auth scope.
Preserve the existing implementation and its dedicated task plan. Prove token
admission, runtime checks, built entrypoints, reviews, and exact-head feedback;
merge only with required checks and protected approval satisfied.

Goal plan:
docs/plans/475-autoclosure.md

Template:
docs/plans/templates/autoclosure.md

Primary template:
docs/plans/templates/autoclosure.md

Applied packs:
- agent-native (docs/plans/templates/packs/agent-native.md)

Completion threshold:
- Dedicated task: docs/plans/2026-09-30-harden-optimistic-auth-identity-guard.md.
- All 13 source-backed identity/settlement case groups must pass, including
  separately built auth/client, react, HTTP, and Start entrypoints.
- Required runtime and repository gates pass; exact-head independent review
  and feedback have no accepted unresolved findings.
- No new product scope. Completion requires every applicable lane below to have
  fresh evidence, `bun check` passing, review findings closed, authorized
  GitHub delivery complete, and the goal checker passing.

Verification surface:
- Focused Vitest auth-client/react/auth-start suites; package build and built
  entrypoint integration; fixture check; `bun check`; independent shipping
  verifier; agent-native source/mirror audit; final autoreview; raw GitHub
  comments, reviews, threads, required checks, protections and head read-back.

Constraints:
- Finish the intended delta; do not invent the next feature.
- Preserve source/generated/package/docs ownership.
- Use a different diagnostic after repeated failure signatures.

Boundaries:
- intended delta: page-wide guarded token admission and client auth settlement.
- allowed repairs: bugs in that contract, its existing tests/docs, stale task
  evidence, generated ownership, and missing verification.
- unrelated files: preserve; do not treat as blockers
- non-goals: new auth features, unrelated PRs, bypassing protections, changing
  Vercel team membership, or closing usable work for incomplete evidence.

Output budget strategy:
- Audit changed files and their direct owners; save full command output under
  /tmp/pr475-*.log and report bounded summaries. Delegate read-only grounding,
  comment audit and independent verification with exclusive worktrees.

Blocked condition:
- Another authorized reviewer must satisfy protected code-owner/last-push
  approval. Runtime port conflicts are diagnosed without killing unrelated
  processes. Never infer native-goal creation authority from this task.

Start Gates:
| Gate | Applies | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated task invocation and plan for exact PR | yes | Resume task for exact PR #475; existing dedicated plan |
| Task evidence verified at PR head | yes | Body names plan; fetched f9016674 contains plan naming #475: COMPLETE |
| Active source/plan reconstructed | yes | Existing 13 case groups; package registry/provider/HTTP/Start source |
| Intended delta and exclusions recorded | yes | Boundaries above |
| Closure matrix classified | yes | Applicable lanes below; absent-state close is N/A |
| Live PR feedback target resolved | conditional | exact compliant PR for full `resolve-pr-feedback` mode; N/A after verified noncompliant close |
| Feedback proof checkout bound to PR head | conditional | local committed `HEAD` = fetched PR ref = live `headRefOid` for a compliant PR |
| Unfiltered feedback inventory | conditional | raw top-level comments/reviews plus all resolved/unresolved inline threads compared with helper output for a compliant PR |
| GitHub delivery expectation recorded | yes | Update same PR; guarded merge only when ready |
| Active goal checked or created | yes | Native get_goal returned null; creation not authorized; this plan tracks closeout |
| Agent-native pack selected | yes | Published auth guidance and generated mirror changed |
| Agent-facing action surface identified | yes | Auth identity guard setup and proof through public package entrypoints |
| Source rule versus generated mirror boundary identified | yes | packages/kitcn/skills/kitcn/references/features/auth.md owns .agents mirror |
| Installed-skill lock versus local-rule owner identified | yes | No installed workflow or lock changes; published package reference only |
| `agent-native-reviewer` loaded or waiver recorded | yes | Loaded; parity audit required before closeout |

Work Checklist:
- [ ] Every PR has its own `task` invocation and dedicated task plan; a batch
      plan or aggregate autoclosure is not used as a substitute.
- [ ] Task evidence was verified from the PR body, fetched head, and exact PR
      ownership; otherwise the required comment and `CLOSED` state were read
      back and no source review, repair, merge, or release work continued.
- [ ] Intended behavior and exclusions are reconstructed from real sources.
- [ ] Each lane is proven or N/A with a concrete reason.
- [ ] Generated output was changed through its owner and regenerated.
- [ ] Package/docs/skill/fixture/scenario/changeset contracts are synchronized.
- [ ] Full `resolve-pr-feedback` ran for the exact compliant PR; every
      actionable P1-or-higher finding was fixed, proved, replied to, and
      resolved or received the required top-level reply receipt.
- [ ] For a compliant PR, local committed `HEAD`, fetched PR ref, and live
      `headRefOid` matched before proof/reply/resolution and after every push.
      For a noncompliant PR, this and all feedback gates are N/A with the
      required remediation-comment and `CLOSED` receipts.
- [ ] Unfiltered top-level PR comments and review bodies were fetched through
      the GitHub API, compared by ID/URL with helper output, and every excluded
      bot/author item was ledgered; identity alone never dismissed feedback.
      Only the exact terminal receipt produced/read back by this run is exempt
      from the versioned ledger.
- [ ] All inline review threads were fetched with GraphQL cursor pagination
      without filtering resolved/outdated items; every thread has priority,
      rationale, relocation, and proof state in the ledger.
- [ ] Every actionable feedback item has a persisted P0-P3 priority and
      one-sentence rationale from the autoclosure rubric; ambiguous P1-versus-
      lower items fail closed as P1.
- [ ] Every P1-or-higher proof reran after the final material branch push,
      regardless of file type, including resolved or outdated threads that
      disappear from the helper's unresolved-thread output.
- [ ] Feedback was re-fetched after the last push/reply/resolution and shows
      zero unresolved actionable P1-or-higher findings.
- [ ] After all versioned plan/source updates were pushed, the exact-head P1
      proof/read-back receipt was posted to the PR and read back; no terminal
      receipt-only branch push was created. A post-comment `headRefOid` fetch
      matches the OID recorded in that receipt, and a post-comment helper/raw
      feedback fetch still shows zero actionable P1-or-higher items and no new
      URL lacking a verdict or explicit deferral, except the verified receipt.
- [ ] Any remaining P2-or-lower item has its exact URL plus the user's explicit
      priority deferral recorded; no feedback was silently ignored.
- [ ] Accepted cleanup and review findings are closed.
- [ ] PR body and check state match the final evidence.
- [ ] Residual blocker/waiver has exact evidence and next owner.
- [ ] Agent-native pack: source-of-truth rule files are edited instead of generated skill mirrors.
- [ ] Agent-native pack: the changed agent action is discoverable from the skill/rule text.
- [ ] Agent-native pack: generated mirrors are synced when `.agents/rules/**` changed, or N/A reason is recorded.
- [ ] Agent-native pack: installed skills are changed only through
      `npx skills add/update/remove`; local rules/templates/helpers stay source-owned.
- [ ] Agent-native pack: routing, required receipts, placeholder failure,
      completion representability, and forbidden behavior have eval/smoke rows.
- [ ] Agent-native pack: accepted agent-native review findings are fixed or explicitly rejected with reason.
